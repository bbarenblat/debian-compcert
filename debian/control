Description: Formally verified C compiler
 CompCert is an optimizing C compiler produced by INRIA.  It supports a
 substantial subset of C99 and a superset of MISRA-C 2004, and it produces
 code roughly comparable in performance to GCC -O1 specified.  Furthermore, it
 has been mathematically proven bug-free: An executable generated by CompCert
 will behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the original C source.
